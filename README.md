Ingreda — Understand Food Ingredients, Instantly

Ingreda is an AI-powered web app that helps you understand what’s really in your food.

Instead of showing complex nutrition tables or raw ingredient data, Ingreda explains ingredient labels in simple human language, so you can decide whether a food is good to eat, okay occasionally, or best avoided.

No databases.
No accounts.
Just clarity.

🌟 What Ingreda Can Do

You can give Ingreda ingredient information in multiple ways:

✍️ Paste ingredient text

📷 Upload a photo of an ingredient label

🎤 Speak ingredients using voice input

📸 Scan ingredients using your camera

🔊 Listen to the AI read the result aloud (female voice)

Ingreda then:

Explains why the ingredients matter

Shows trade-offs

Gives a clear recommendation

Visually adapts the UI (🟢 / 🟡 / 🔴) based on how suitable the food is

🎯 Who This Is For

Anyone curious about food ingredients

Students, families, everyday consumers

Hackathon judges & demo viewers

No technical background required to use the app

🖥️ Tech Stack (Simple Explanation)

Frontend: React (UI you see in the browser)

Backend: Node.js + Express (AI logic)

AI: Google Gemini (for reasoning)

OCR: Extracts text from label images

Deployment: Vercel (frontend) + Render (backend)

🚀 Running Ingreda on Your Local Machine (Step-by-Step)

Follow these steps carefully — you do not need deep technical knowledge.

✅ Step 1: Install Required Software

Install these once:

Node.js (v18 or later)
https://nodejs.org
 (choose LTS)

Git
https://git-scm.com

Restart your computer after installing.

✅ Step 2: Clone the Project

Open Command Prompt / Terminal and run:

git clone <your-repository-url>


Move into the project folder:

cd ingreda

✅ Step 3: Set Up the Backend

Go to the backend folder:

cd backend


Install dependencies:

npm install

✅ Step 4: Create Backend Environment File

Inside the backend folder, create a file named:

.env


Add the following:

PORT=5000
NODE_ENV=development

GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
GEMINI_MODEL=gemini-1.5-flash


🔑 Get a Gemini API key from:
👉 https://aistudio.google.com

(Keep this key private.)

✅ Step 5: Start the Backend Server

Still inside /backend, run:

node index.js


You should see:

Server running on port 5000


Leave this terminal open.

✅ Step 6: Set Up the Frontend

Open a new terminal window and go to the frontend folder:

cd frontend


Install dependencies:

npm install


ℹ️ No .env file is required for the frontend.

✅ Step 7: Start the Frontend

Run:

npm run dev


You’ll see something like:

Local: http://localhost:5173


Open that link in your browser 🎉
